# Uncommon Python Error Demonstration

This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur in Python:

1. **ZeroDivisionError:**  Attempting to divide by zero.
2. **Error in handling negative power with non-integer base**:  Raising a non-integer to a negative power can lead to unexpected results or exceptions.

The `bug.py` file contains the code with these errors.  `bugSolution.py` provides a solution demonstrating appropriate error handling and alternative approaches for such cases.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Python.
